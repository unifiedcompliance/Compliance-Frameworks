# The Main Thing

The Main Thing here is threefold:

1. You need to be able to understand and explain to others what it means to comply.
2. You need to communicate with your organization and create a list, catalog, whatever you want to call it, of the Authority Documents you must comply with.
3. To avoid being overwhelmed by the poor writing in these Authority Documents and the gross amount of overlap between them, you should create a Common Controls Catalog from your list of Authority Documents.
