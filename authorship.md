# Authorship

Portions of this work, mostly everything from the Organization Structures section, were drawn from a work published in 2007;

> Cougias, Dorian J., Marcelo Halpern, and Rebecca Herold. 2007. _Say What You Do: Building a Framework of It Controls, Policies, Standards, and Procedures._ Lecanto, Fla.: Shaser-Vartan.

It is with great pride that weâ€™ve reached out to both Rebecca and Marcelo and gotten their permission to re-create and update that material. To both of you, a **huge** thank you from our team!
