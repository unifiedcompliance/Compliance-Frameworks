# ISTJ – Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Sensing – concerns itself with actualities, attends to details

* Real data – why is the change occurring?
* Specifics about what exactly is to change.
* Connections between the changes and the past.
* Realistic pictures of the future that make plans real.
* Clear guidelines on expectations, roles, and responsibilities.

### Thinking – depends on impersonal procedures and principles

* Clarity in the decision making and the planning.
* Demonstration that leadership is competent.
* Fairness and equitability in the changes.
* The logic – Why? What are the goals? What systemic changes will there be?

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. This character type likes to brainstorm as much as possible. Prepare thought-out written communications and prepare for in-depth one-on-one discussions.
2. Get to the point. What plan or direction are you proposing? What are the impacts to the organization, its staff, and its processes? What are the priorities and timeframes for each?
3. Leadership will want time to think and talk about what is going to happen and will want input in developing the plan. Managers will want to know what you expect of them. They will ask questions, so answer all questions in a timely manner. Be prepared to log them as well so that you can include them, and the answers you’ve provided, in future communications.
4. What is the plan? Prepare a “who, what, when, how” plan with each stage’s action items and guestimated costs documented.
5. Do Not surprise this group. Do not set up a meeting without sending written documentation to read/edit/question before an in-person meeting. This group needs time alone to think and reflect and prepare. Spontaneity is not welcomed.
