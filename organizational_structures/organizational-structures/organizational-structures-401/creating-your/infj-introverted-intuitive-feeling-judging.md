# INFJ – Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Intuitive – concerns itself with possibilities, attends to the big picture

* The overall rationale – the global realities.
* A general plan or direction to play around with and develop.
* Chances to paint a picture of the future – to create a vision.
* Options – a general direction, but not too much structure.
* Opportunities to participate in designing the future.

### Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs

* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Put compliance into the context of the big picture. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the vision of the future, including parallel factors.
2. Do not focus on the small details. This OCI character trait isn’t interested in the minutia, too many facts, too many details.
3. What are the impacts to the organization, its staff, its processes? What are the impacts on current budgets and restraints?
4. Provide a clear and concise plan of action, including who is doing what, by when, and what the presumptive costs might be.
5. And most important of all – ask for input at every conceivable point. Leadership will want time to think and talk about what is going to happen and will want input in developing the plan. Managers will want to know what you expect of them. And you will have to communicate how individuals' needs are being dealt with.
