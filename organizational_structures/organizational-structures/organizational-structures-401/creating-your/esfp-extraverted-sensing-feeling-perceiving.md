# ESFP – Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Extraverted – focuses outward, responds to external stimuli

* Time to talk about what is going on during the change process.
* They want something to do as a part of the change process.
* Communication, communication, communication.
* They want to be heard – to have a voice in the change process.
* They desire action, getting on with it, keeping up the pace.

### Sensing – concerns itself with actualities, attends to details

* Real data – why is the change occurring?
* Specifics about what exactly is to change.
* Connections between the changes and the past.
* Realistic pictures of the future that make plans real.
* Clear guidelines on expectations, roles, and responsibilities.

### Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs

* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Perceiving – likes to keep options open, distrusts too much definition

* An open-ended plan.
* The general parameters.
* Flexibility, with lots of options.
* Information and the opportunity to gather more.
* Loosen up, don’t panic, trust the process.

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. The plan must be both brief and clear. What are the goals? What evolutionary, systemic changes will there be? Take any “fluff” out of the plan. Nothing qualitative, only quantitative.
2. They want real data about why compliance changes are necessary, what compliance changes are necessary, and costs (time, money, materials) for compliance changes.
3. Does the plan sound simple? KISS is the idea here. If the plan sounds complex, it will fail.
4. What has and hasn’t worked in the past and what is the realistic picture of the future?
5. What are the options? This type of organization likes to weigh the options before making a final decision. Give them options to weigh in on.
6. Go heavy on visual aids. The more visual the plan, the better. You might want to think about using “listicles” as a means for communication.
7. Allow time (during and after meetings, time to respond to messages and e-mails) for listen-ing to other’s perspectives. Leadership and management will want their own chance to paint the picture for you, but only after they’ve internalized it.
