# INTJ – Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Intuitive – concerns itself with possibilities, attends to the big picture

* The overall rationale – the global realities.
* A general plan or direction to play around with and develop.
* Chances to paint a picture of the future – to create a vision.
* Options – a general direction, but not too much structure.
* Opportunities to participate in designing the future.

### Thinking – depends on impersonal procedures and principles

* Clarity in the decision making and the planning.
* Demonstration that leadership is competent.
* Fairness and equitability in the changes.
* The logic – Why? What are the goals? What systemic changes will there be?

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. There is nothing spontaneous about this group. Plan for in-person meetings and make appointments with plenty of time to act.
2. Ensure that every stakeholder is involved at the appropriate time and place. Missing one of the stakeholders in this type of organization is a major faux pas and will brand you as tact-less.
3. Present the situation in context. Be prepared for both a written and in-person presentation. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the organization’s future realities (such as staying in business)?
4. Focus on the relevance of the compliance plan. What is the logical, traceable connection between what you must comply with and why that is pertinent to this organization? Provide details that link compliance requirements to systematic changes necessary to comply.
5. Present the gaps between what compliance is mandating you do and what you are doing as problem statements. Then include solutions (and their logic) for each problem. If there are options for those solutions, present the options as this type of organization likes to weigh in on options.
