# ESFJ – Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Extraverted – focuses outward, responds to external stimuli

* Time to talk about what is going on during the change process.
* They want something to do as a part of the change process.
* Communication, communication, communication.
* They want to be heard – to have a voice in the change process.
* They desire action, getting on with it, keeping up the pace.

### Sensing – concerns itself with actualities, attends to details

* Real data – why is the change occurring?
* Specifics about what exactly is to change.
* Connections between the changes and the past.
* Realistic pictures of the future that make plans real.
* Clear guidelines on expectations, roles, and responsibilities.

### Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs

* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Put compliance into context. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the organization’s day-to-day realities (such as staying in business)?
2. What is the plan of action? What are the priorities and timeframes for each compliance initiative?
3. Leadership will want to interact with the plan, to ask questions for clarity. If presenting in person, those you are presenting to will want to “think out loud”, so ensure there is time allotted during your meetings for that.
4. What are the next steps, commitments, costs? This can’t be an open-ended plan. It has to be a realistic, no surprises, concise and clear-goaled plan.
