# INTP – Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Intuitive – concerns itself with possibilities, attends to the big picture

* The overall rationale – the global realities.
* A general plan or direction to play around with and develop.
* Chances to paint a picture of the future – to create a vision.
* Options – a general direction, but not too much structure.
* Opportunities to participate in designing the future.

### Thinking – depends on impersonal procedures and principles

* Clarity in the decision making and the planning.
* Demonstration that leadership is competent.
* Fairness and equitability in the changes.
* The logic – Why? What are the goals? What systemic changes will there be?

### Perceiving – likes to keep options open, distrusts too much definition

* An open-ended plan.
* The general parameters.
* Flexibility, with lots of options.
* Information and the opportunity to gather more.
* Loosen up, don’t panic, trust the process.

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Plan most of the communications around e-mails and messages. This OCI character trait isn’t that big into in-person meetings.
2. The plan must be both brief and clear. What are the goals? What evolutionary, systemic changes will there be? Take any “fluff” out of the plan. Nothing qualitative, only quantitative.
3. Be transparent. Make sure you aren’t sugar-coating anything and provide both points of view. If any attempts had been made in the past and failed, don’t forget to point that out. You need a realistic picture of any change the compliance plan will bring.
4. What is the plan? Prepare a “who, what, when, how” plan with each stage’s action items and guestimated costs documented.
5. Most important is what you need in terms of support (money, time, resources) from leadership. They aren’t as interested in the plan, per se, as their involvement in the plan.
