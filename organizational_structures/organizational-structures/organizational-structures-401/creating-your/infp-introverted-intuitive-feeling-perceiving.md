# INFP – Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Intuitive – concerns itself with possibilities, attends to the big picture

* The overall rationale – the global realities.
* A general plan or direction to play around with and develop.
* Chances to paint a picture of the future – to create a vision.
* Options – a general direction, but not too much structure.
* Opportunities to participate in designing the future.

### Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs

* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Perceiving – likes to keep options open, distrusts too much definition

* An open-ended plan.
* The general parameters.
* Flexibility, with lots of options.
* Information and the opportunity to gather more.
* Loosen up, don’t panic, trust the process.

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Put compliance into the context of the big picture. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the vision of the future, including parallel factors.
2. Use plenty of analogies to link an unfamiliar or a new idea with common and familiar objects. This makes it is easier for this OCI type to comprehend a new idea, which may have been difficult for them to understand otherwise.
3. Be transparent. Make sure you aren’t sugar-coating anything and provide both points of view. If any attempts had been made in the past and failed, don’t forget to point that out. You need a realistic picture of any change the compliance plan will bring.
4. Plan the communication around memos, emails, messages. This type of organization is more receptive to new ideas when they can read and internalize them, giving them time to think and ask questions.
5. Provide a clear and concise plan of action, including who is doing what, by when, and what the presumptive costs might be.
