# ENFJ – Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Extraverted – focuses outward, responds to external stimuli

* Time to talk about what is going on during the change process.
* They want something to do as a part of the change process.
* Communication, communication, communication.
* They want to be heard – to have a voice in the change process.
* They desire action, getting on with it, keeping up the pace.

### Intuitive – concerns itself with possibilities, attends to the big picture

* The overall rationale – the global realities.
* A general plan or direction to play around with and develop.
* Chances to paint a picture of the future – to create a vision.
* Options – a general direction, but not too much structure.
* Opportunities to participate in designing the future.

### Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs

* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Put compliance into context. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the organization’s day-to-day realities \(such as staying in business\)?
2. Get to the point. What plan or direction are you proposing? What are the impacts to the organization, its staff, and its processes? What are the priorities and timeframes for each?
3. Let the team know what you need from them. Leadership will want time to think and talk about what is going to happen and will want input in developing the plan. Managers will want to know what you expect of them. And you will have to communicate how individual’s needs are being dealt with.
