* Demonstration that leadership is competent.
* Fairness and equitability in the changes.
* The logic – Why? What are the goals? What systemic changes will there be?

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. First and foremost, explain why you are bringing this to leadership’s attention. Leadership is intuitive and wants to participate in designing the future, but they have to know why compliance is important to the organization.
2. The plan must be both brief and clear. What are the goals? What evolutionary, systemic changes will there be?
3. Respect everyone’s time. This communication plan better be edited and any presentation rehearsed. Leadership’s time needs to be respected. Do not exceed any time allocated for meetings.
4. What is the logic behind the path to compliance. They want to know your leadership is competent. However, leadership will want time to think and talk about what is going to happen and will want input in developing the plan. Giving them the rationale behind the plan will help.
5. Allow time (during and after meetings, time to respond to messages and e-mails) for listening to other’s perspectives. Leadership and management will want their own chance to paint the picture for you, but only after they’ve internalized it.
