# ISFJ – Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Sensing – concerns itself with actualities, attends to details

* Real data – why is the change occurring?
* Specifics about what exactly is to change.
* Connections between the changes and the past.
* Realistic pictures of the future that make plans real.
* Clear guidelines on expectations, roles, and responsibilities. Feeling – reaches conclusions on the basis of values and beliefs
* Recognition of the impacts on people.
* Demonstration that leadership cares.
* Appreciation and support.
* Inclusion of themselves and others in the planning and implementing on change.
* Know how individuals’ needs will be dealt with.

### Judging – likes things spelled out and definite, seeks closure

* A clear, concise plan of action.
* Defined outcomes, clear goals.
* A clear statement of priorities.
* A time frame, with each stage spelled out.
* No more surprises!

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. Put compliance into the context of the big picture. What is the overall rationale, and where does that fit within the vision of the future, including parallel factors.
2. What is the plan? Prepare a “who, what, when, how” plan with each stage’s action items and guestimated costs documented. Most important is what you need in terms of support \(money, time, resources\) from leadership. They aren’t as interested in the plan, per se, as their involvement in the plan.
3. The plan must be detailed, skipping any “pie in the sky” discussions. Estimates of costs, time, resources should be as close as possible.
4. Present the situation in context. Be prepared for both a written and in-person presentation.
5. Allow time \(during and after meetings, time to respond to messages and e-mails\) for listening to other’s perspectives. Leadership and management will want their own chance to paint the picture for you, but only after they’ve internalized it.
