# ISTP – Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving

Here are the traits for this organizational character type:

### Introverted – takes cues and draws power from within, is fairly closed

* Time alone to reflect on what is happening.
* To be asked what they think.
* Thought-out, written communication and one-on-one discussion.
* Time to think things through before discussions and meetings.
* Time to assimilate change before taking action.

### Sensing – concerns itself with actualities, attends to details

* Real data – why is the change occurring?
* Specifics about what exactly is to change.
* Connections between the changes and the past.
* Realistic pictures of the future that make plans real.
* Clear guidelines on expectations, roles, and responsibilities.

### Thinking – depends on impersonal procedures and principles

* Clarity in the decision making and the planning.
* Demonstration that leadership is competent.
* Fairness and equitability in the changes.
* The logic – Why? What are the goals? What systemic changes will there be?

### Perceiving – likes to keep options open, distrusts too much definition

* An open-ended plan.
* The general parameters.
* Flexibility, with lots of options.
* Information and the opportunity to gather more.
* Loosen up, don’t panic, trust the process.

### Boiling this down into a plan

All of the above can be boiled down into these main points:

1. The plan must be both brief and clear. What are the goals? What evolutionary, systemic changes will there be? Take any “fluff” out of the plan. Nothing qualitative, only quantitative.
2. Does the plan sound simple? KISS is the idea here. If the plan sounds complex, it will fail.
3. What is the logical order of the plan? Provide a clear and concise plan of action, including who is doing what, by when, and what the presumptive costs might be.
4. Allow time \(during and after meetings, time to respond to messages and e-mails\) for listening to other’s perspectives. Leadership and management will want their own chance to paint the picture for you, but only after they’ve internalized it.
