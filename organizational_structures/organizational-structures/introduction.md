# Introduction

What does it take for organizations to be successful at implementing various compliance programs? To begin with, you have to know what you need to know.

Ultimately, how compliance is applied across an organization’s structure will either help or hinder its Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) programs. But before you can apply a compliance program, you have to discover what you need to know as it applies to each group or department within your organizational structure.

Organizations just don’t become collectively aware of compliance. They become aware department or groupings at a time. As applicable to that department or group’s compliance issues at the time they become aware.

The foundation of compliance awareness, then, is awareness within (and of) the organizational structure.
