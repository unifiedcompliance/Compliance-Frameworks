# Organizational Structures 101

The two short sections that follow \(Understanding organizational structures and The basics of leadership and communication\) will give you a basic grasp of how organizations are structured and how communications flow. A _basic_ grasp.

You can use these two short chapters to create a very simple compliance communication plan.

Beyond that, organizations, like people, can be very complex. We present _Organizational Structures 401,_ as it represents a senior-level mini-course on how organizational power and communication works in the real world.

You can use the very detailed survey at the end of this section to create a Meyers-Briggs assessment of your organization and use _that_ for a communications plan.
