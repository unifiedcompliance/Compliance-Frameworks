# The Main Thing

The Main Thing you need to understand from this chapter is that yes, all organizations are alike _in some limited ways_. However, organizations differ according to their age, their structures, and their communication patterns. You must understand _your_ organization in terms of those three facets.

This Chapter will provide you with two levels of understanding - a basic level, and an advanced level. We provide you with both because people's needs differ. Both are effective, one is just more in-depth \(if you are ready for it\).
